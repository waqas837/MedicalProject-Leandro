				"description": "# API Endpoint: List Facilities by Country Code\n\nThis endpoint retrieves a list of facilities based on the specified country code. If no country code is provided, it will return all available facilities.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe primary purpose of this request is to obtain information about facilities filtered by a specific country code. For example, using 'DO' will return facilities in the Dominican Republic, while 'CO' will return those in Colombia.\n\n## Input Parameters\n\n- **country_code** (optional): A string representing the country code to filter the facilities.\n    \n    - Example:\n        \n        - 'DO' for Dominican Republic\n            \n        - 'CO' for Colombia\n            \n\n## Expected Response Structure\n\nOn a successful request (HTTP status 200), the response will be in JSON format and will include:\n\n- **status**: A string indicating the status of the request.\n    \n- **data**: An array of facility objects, where each object contains:\n    \n    - **id_facility**: A unique identifier for the company (string).\n        \n    - **facility_name**: The name of the facility (string).\n        \n    - **city**: City where facility is located (string).\n        \n    - **country_iso**: The ISO code of the country (string).\n        \n\n### Example Response\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"status\": \"\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id_facility\": \"\",\n      \"facility_name\": \"\",\n      \"city\": \"\",\n      \"country_iso\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n ```\n\nThis structure allows consumers of the API to easily access and utilize the relevant details about each facility, such as its name and location.\n\nThis endpoint retrieves a list of facilities associated with a specific company, identified by the provided company code. It is useful for applications that need to display or manage facilities linked to a particular organization.\n\n## Request\n\n**Method:** GET  \n**URL:** `https://api.orkachart.com/v1/leads/list-facilities/{company_code}`\n\n### Path Parameters\n\n- **company_code** (string): The unique identifier for the company whose facilities are being requested. Replace `{company_code}` with the actual code when making the request.\n    \n\n## Response\n\nOn a successful request, the API will return a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n### Response Structure\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"status\": \"\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id_facility\": \"\",\n      \"facility_name\": \"\",\n      \"city\": \"\",\n      \"country_iso\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n ```\n\n### Response Fields\n\n- **status** (string): Indicates the status of the request. Typically, this will be an empty string if the request was successful.\n    \n- **data** (array): An array of facility objects, each containing:\n    \n    - **id_md_company** (string): The unique identifier for the company.\n        \n    - **facility_name** (string): The name of the facility.\n        \n    - **country_iso** (string): The ISO code representing the country where the facility is located.\n        \n\n### Example Response\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"status\": \"\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id_faciity\": \"3\",\n      \"facility_name\": \"Main Office\",\n      \"city\": \"Medellin\",\n      \"country_iso\": \"CO\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n ```\n\n## Usage Notes\n\n- Ensure that the correct company code is provided in the request path to receive the relevant facilities.\n    \n- The response will include all facilities associated with the specified company, allowing users to manage or display this information as needed.\n    \n- The structure of the response is consistent with other endpoints in the API, facilitating easier integration and handling of data across different API calls."
